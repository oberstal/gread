\title{Generate non-overlapping intron coordinates}
\usage{
non_overlaps(x, transcript_id = "transcript_id", gene_id = "gene_id")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{gtf/gff} object which has to have 
features \code{intron} and \code{exon}.}

\item{transcript_id}{Column name in \code{x} corresponding to transcript id.}

\item{gene_id}{Column name in \code{x} corresponding to gene id.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of \code{GRanges} objects containing 
\emph{non overlapping exons} and \emph{non overlapping introns}.
}
\description{
This function takes an \code{gtf/gff} object. If the 
features \code{exon} and \code{intron} are present, then, it attempts 
to find a set of exon and intron coordinates that do NOT overlap with each 
other. If the intron coordinates are not present, it constructs the introns 
first using \code{gread::construct_introns} and then attempts to extract 
non-overlapping exonic and intronic coordinates. If \code{exon} feature is 
not present, it returns an error.

Note: This function is not exported at the moment.
