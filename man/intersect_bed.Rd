\title{Extract gtf coordinates intersecting input bed file}
\usage{
intersect_bed(gtf_file, bed_file, select_features)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf_file}{Full path to a \code{gtf} file.}

\item{bed_file}{Full path to a \code{bed} file. The file must contain at 
least three columns, with them corresponding to \code{seqnames} (or 
\code{chr}), \code{start} and \code{end}.}

\item{select_features}{A 1-column \code{data.table} or a named list of 
length=1. The name of the list indicates the column in the \code{gtf} file 
to filter on. The column/value should be a \emph{character} vector 
containing the values to \emph{retain}.}
}
\value{
A \code{gtf} object that inherits from \code{GRanges} containing 
just those transcripts that overlap with the provided bed file.
}
\description{
Given a \code{gtf} file, and a \code{bed} file, this function 
extracts all \emph{transcripts} that overlap with coordinates from 
\code{bed} file and returns a \emph{filtered} \code{gtf} file. This 
function is at the moment only for internal purposes.
