We've developed three packages for performing differential analysis of NGS 
data, namely `gread`, `gcount` and `ganalyse`. In short,

* *gread* enables loading or reading in the required data quickly from many 
different formats in which NGS data and gene annotations are available. 

* *gcount* counts the reads depending on user configuration on *raw* counts.

* *ganalyse* then allows to perform differential gene expression analysis 
using many methods such as *limma*, *voomlimma* (for `FPKM`), *edger* on the 
read counts.

In this vignette, we'll discuss the `gread` package.

***

## gread package

`gread` is an R-package that allows to read and process gene annotations and 
NGS data. Currently supported formats include:

* Gene Feature Format or `gff`,
* Gene Transfer Format or `gtf` (also referred to as `gff v2.5` at times),
* Browser Extensible Data or `bed` format, and
* Binary sequence alignment/map Format or `bam` format

You can use the function `supported_formats()` to check all available formats. 

```{r}
supported_formats()
```

## Reading files quickly

There are four functions, one for each type of format. 

### `read_gtf`

```{r}
(gtf = read_gtf("sample.gtf"))
class(gtf)
```

### `read_gff`

```{r}
(gff = read_gff("sample.gff"))
class(gff)
```

### `read_bed`

```{r}
(bed = read_bed("sample.bed")) ## bed9, bed12 and bed15 formats
class(bed)
```

### `read_bam`

```{r}
(bam = read_bam("sample.bam"))
class(bam)
```

#### {.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}

* All functions have a set of common arguments, and might contain additional 
arguments specific to that particular format. See `?<function_name>` for more 
details.

* You can filter invalid rows by using the `filter` argument. Default value 
is `FALSE`, i.e., load *all* rows.

* There are some additional arguments for `read_bam` function to load extra 
tags. If you are not familiar with it, it's better to leave this argument 
untouched.

* All these functions are objects of class `gtf`, `gff` `bed` and `bam` 
respectively. They inherit from `data.table`.

### `read_format`

While these functions are quite easy and straightforward to use, there's 
another function `read_format()` that makes things even simpler and is 
sufficient in most cases.

```{r}
# gtf file
(gtf = read_format("sample.gtf"))

# gff file
(gff = read_format("sample.gff"))

# bam file
(bam = read_format("sample.bam"))

# bed file
(bed = read_format("sample.bed"))
```

#### {.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}

* The function recognises the file format automatically with proper defaults. 
So for most cases with default scenarios, this is quite useful.

### Extracting various features

The `gread()` package provides an useful function `extract()` to extract 
useful features from `gtf` and `gff` objects. This vignette provides a short 
description of the function. See `?extract` for more.

In a typical `RNA-seq` experiment, we would want to extract the *genes* 
`start-end` coordinates and also just the *exons*. This is because, the 
default methodology is to extract the *reads* that overlap *exons* and count 
the total number of reads that overlap only those *exonic* regions for that 
*gene*. Extracting *genes* and *exons* into separate *data.tables* makes 
things easier to obtain counts then using the `gcount` package.

```{r}
gtf = read_format("sample.gtf")
## Extract a unified gene model by combining all overlapping exons
(uni_genes = extract(gtf, feature="gene_exon", type="union", 
                 transcript_id="transcript_id", gene_id="gene_id"))
## extract genes as such
(genes = extract(gtf, feature="gene", type="default"))
```

## Other useful functionalities

### Construct intron coordinates

Sometimes the gene annotation formats do not have *intronic* coordintes 
annotated but might be essential. In that case, we can use the 
`construct_introns` function on a `gtf` or `gff` object a follows:

```{r}
gtf = read_format("sample.gtf")
(gtf = construct_introns(gtf, update=TRUE))
(introns = construct_introns(gtf, update=FALSE))

class(gtf)
class(introns)
```

#### Note that: {.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}

* By default, the argument `update` is equal to `TRUE`, which returns an 
updated `gtf` object with the *intron* coordinates added to `gtf` object. 
The class of the input object is retained in result.

* If you require just the introns, set `update = FALSE`.
